	* At begining, we dont know the value of d7 register
move.l  #$99999999,d7	* We set some value to d7 register
	* Then zero flag = 0
move.l  #$00000000,d7	* Then set the value of d7 to "0000 0000"
	*Then zero flag = 1
	* Because " zero flag = 1 " means the value of register == 0 is True

Example,
   ORG    $0000    * all project store in this address
START:                  ; first instruction of program
* Put program code here
    
    move.w  $2000,d0
    move.w  $2002,d1
    cmp.w   d0,d1   * if equal,return 1; else,return 0.[can campare anything]
	* all branch operate based on the flags
    beq equal	* if zero flag = 1 ,that means equal, then run "equal" parts like below.
    bne n_equal	   * if zero flag = 0 ,that means not equal, then run "n_equal" parts like below.
 
equal
    move.w  #1,$2004
    bra halt	* after excution, we have to go out.

n_equal
    move.w  #0,$2004
    bra halt
halt
    * this is empty, just for going out.
