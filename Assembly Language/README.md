For Motorola68000 CPU, I start to learning that because I knew assembly language is a very low-level language that I've been interested in before, and it helps me to better understand the workings of a CPU. And it's also needed in my one course of Newcastle University.

NCL Course Objectives
  Intended Knowledge Outcomes
    The concepts and theory of embedded design, real-time scheduling, concurrent models, interfaces and real-time interfaces (ACM). The concepts and theory of embedded design, real-time scheduling, concurrent models, interfaces and real-time interfaces (ACM). These cover all levels of Bloomâ€™s taxonomy: knowledge, comprehension, methodology of application, synthesis, analysis and evaluation. 
  Intended Skill Outcomes
    Manipulation of concurrency models, embedded programming for ARM embedded platform, implementation of a simple real-time scheduler, ability to apply the principles and theory to worked examples.
